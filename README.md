#CS465 Full Stack Developement

Over the course of this project, I built a full stack web application that combined server-rendered pages with a modern single-page application (SPA) experience. The administrative side, built in Angular, offered a smooth and dynamic way to manage trip listings, while the customer-facing side used Express and Handlebars to deliver simpler, SEO-friendly pages. Balancing these two approaches allowed me to see the tradeoffs between fast-rendered content and richer interactive frontends.

For the backend, I used a NoSQL MongoDB database, which made it easy to work with JSON across both the server and client without complicated transformations. MongoDBâ€™s flexible structure suited the evolving needs of the project, especially as trip information grew more complex. JSON became the bridge that tied everything together. Although it shares a syntax style with JavaScript, JSON stands on its own as a way to pass structured data between the Angular frontend, the Node.js server, and MongoDB itself. This common language made it easier to refactor parts of the system as needed. One example was when I refactored the TripListing and TripCard components to improve code reuse and simplify the trip display flow. Breaking things into smaller pieces not only made the UI more consistent but also made maintenance and future expansion simpler.

Testing the system, especially around the API endpoints, gave me a better appreciation for how crucial security layers like JWT authentication are. Each request needed careful handling, particularly when dealing with tokens, CORS rules, and ensuring only authorized users could perform actions like adding or editing trips. Seeing the full stack working from secure login through authenticated actions helped solidify the connection between endpoints, methods, and user permissions. This course pushed me to build a project from the ground up and handle real-world development problems at each layer. I leave this experience with a much stronger grasp of building full stack applications, and more importantly, with a better sense of how to structure clean, maintainable, and secure systems. This will definitely be something I reference in the future as I continue growing toward professional development work.
